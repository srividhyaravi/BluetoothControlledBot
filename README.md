# Bluetooth Controlled Bot
The project includes the functionality of a normal remote controlled car, except that this is done using Arduino Uno microcontroller which uses a bluetooth module HC-05 and is controlled by a mobile application. 
 
### CIRCUIT CONNECTIONS:

The Arduino must be connected to the Bluetooth module(HC-05) ,IC driver and power supply. Connections are also to be established between the IC Driver and the power supply and DC motors. Also, the RX pin(receive) of the Bluetooth module should be connected to TX pin(transmit) of Arduino and vice versa. In addition to this, the PWM pins numbered 5 and 6 are to be connected to the left motor and pins 10 , 11 to the right motor.)
